const types = [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100]
const toire = types.length //I can't reliably spell repertoire 

const reducer = (previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue + currentValue; //this is for finding the sum of an array with array.reduce(reducer)


//To do: eventually rewrite in TypeScript proper so that dice can have values and names
